2. Collision Detection

3. Objective Function
What we want to do: 
- Minimize the volume occupied by 3D objects in a theoretical 3D printer volume
    
Ensure placement of objects within bounds of the theoretical printer volume without overlap -> penalties
- the overlap penalty (contstraint 1: objects must not overlap)
- the boundary penalty (constraint 2: objects must stay inside)

Formula:
 f = occupied_vol + lam * (overlap_penalty + boundary_penalty)

The parameter lam (lambda) controls how strictly contraints are enforced. 
Higher lam = algorithm prioritizes valid placements over minimizing empty space.

A perfect solution has no constraint violations at all
Penalty-Formulierung wird in studien gebracuht bei irregulären packing, 
da man ein algorithmus keine Regeln versteht, macht man das verstosse hoche werte ergeben,
weil wir das minimum wollen ist klar dases dann nicht sauber ist
